Using the tmdb API

 I got the initial interface set up. It's basically just a bunch of movie posters filtered by year and genre.

 The font for the headers is: (forgot again)

 Clicking on a poster brings up some details about that particular movie. I added reviews if they're available as well.

 Also adjusted the time scale to go back to 1888 instead of 1929 for the start. It turns out there were a lot of movies made before 1929.

 TODO:
   -- change the css on the pulldowns because that pink and green is kind of clashy. I built it based on the old design.

     -- DONE went with blue and orange. Not much better

   -- Add more details to the details panel

        -- popularity

        -- income

        -- cast 

          -- DONE. Added cast photos and cast member details when user clicks the photo

        -- genres

   -- embed trailers if they're available. Right now they have links in the API to youtube trailers, so the player would have to be real tiny to fit in the details panel, or else a pop-up or just an external link
